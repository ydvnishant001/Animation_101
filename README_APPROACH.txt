Hello there.

I did the 3 steps for this assignment. I had to learn canvas and do repetitive trial and error to 
get what was happening. Stackoverflow, mdn and google helped me plenty.
For the next step I wanted to use CCapture.js library or mediaRecorder API. The basic idea was to
capture everything on my canvas element for 5 seconds, into an object and save those frames in form 
of gifs and then convert that gif into a video file. I tried but I couldn't figure out where to start. 

You were right as 24 hours were not enough for this app. I did enjoy learning what I've learned and 
it was worthwhile.
